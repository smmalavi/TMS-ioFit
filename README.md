# TMS ioFit

TMS ioFit is an open-source Matlab-based toolbox for fast, accurate and automated estimation of neural recruitment or input-output (IO) curves and parameters with closed-loop transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) optimal sampling method, where the intensity of TMS pulses is chosen optimally and sequentially from the locations of maximum information. 

TMS ioFit administers a train of TMS pulses, updates the estimation after each pulse, and continues the process until the IO curve and parameters are estimated with a desired and adjustable level of accuracy.

TMS ioFit also supports the IO curve estimation by using the conventional uniform sampling method, where the intensity of TMS pulses is uniformly distributed.  

In comparison with the uniform sampling method, the FIM-based optimal sampling method results in more accurate estimation of the IO curve and parameters with fewer TMS pulses. 

The fundamentals of the FIM optimal-sampling-based IO curve estimation and comparison with the uniform sampling have been discussed in [1]. 

TMS ioFit was developed by the Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, Duke University School of Medicine.

## Hardware and Software

The required hardware and software include:

– TMS stimulator and coil

– EMG recorder. The driver and Matlab interface of the EMG recorder is also needed. 

– A device for the generation of trigger signal. TMS companies might have their own trigger box. 

– [MAGIC toolbox](https://github.com/nigelrogasch/MAGIC/wiki/) [2]

– [TMS ioFit toolbox](https://github.com/smmalavi/TMS-ioFit/)

Currently, we developed TMS ioFit to the [MagVenture MagPro X100 device](https://www.magventure.com/), with the [TMSi Mobi Mini EMG recorder](https://www.tmsi.com/). The [National Instruments myDAQ University Kit](https://www.ni.com/en-ca/shop/select/mydaq-student-data-acquisition-device?modelId=134166/) was used for the generation of the trigger signal. Download and install the TMSi Mobi Mini driver and Matlab interface from [here](https://www.tmsi.com/), and the MAGIC toolbox from [here](https://github.com/smmalavi/TMS-ioFit-2019). Copy all files of the TMS ioFit toolbox from here to the directory of TMSi_Matlab_Interface\trunk\src. 

In order to run, write TMS_ioFit in the Matlab workspace. 

## Overall Estimation Algorithm

The following figure summarizes the algorithm used in TMS ioFit. It starts with baseline data collection from electromyography (EMG) in the absence of TMS pulses. The baseline data help estimate the lower plateau of the IO curve. For the optimal sampling method, three initial TMS pulses are then administered, chosen randomly between the minimum and maximum pulse strengths. The MEP generated by each TMS pulse is recorded, and the peak-to-peak MEP amplitude is measured and log-transformed to normalize the amplitude distribution. These baseline and initial stimulus–response data serve to generate an initial estimate of the IO parameters. The underlying curve-fitting includes bad-fit detection features to avoid estimation instabilities. The strength of the next TMS pulse is computed by maximization of the Fisher information matrix. After each stimulus, the IO parameter estimation is updated with the latest baseline and stimulus–response data. A stopping rule is checked to terminate the estimation process if all parameter values converge for a specified number of consecutive pulses. This means that for all parameters, the absolute value of the estimations difference between consecutive pulses must be less than a tolerance, and repeated for a specified number of times that is defined by the user. The estimation accuracy is adjustable by the stopping rule parameters. If the stopping rule is not satisfied, the estimation will stop at a pre-defined maximum number of pulses.

### Setting TMS devices and EMG recorders
Presently, TMS ioFit is implemented to interface with MagPro TMS devices, but with minor modifications the code can interface with other devices (Magstim, DuoMag) supported by the MAGIC control toolbox, as described in the figure. 

Likewise, other EMG devices can be connected by modifying the code as described in the figure. 

[This file](https://github.com/smmalavi/TMS-ioFit/blob/master/Triggering_PulseAdmin_emgRecordingFilteringPPcal.txt) provides the line-by-line code and information about setting TMS, NI DAQ and Mobi Mini devices, triggering, pulse administration, EMG recording, filtering, and peak-to-peak calculation. This process is run for all TMS pulses.  

[This tutorial](http://mahdialavi.com/index.php/tutorial-external-control-of-tms-device-by-using-magic-toolbox/) provides examples how the TMS device is controlled externally by using the MAGIC toolbox from Matlab. Depending on the device, magventure(‘COMx’), magstim(‘COMx’) or doumag(‘COMx’) must be used.
